Project Summary:    
This project is modeled after the board game called Mastermind. In the game Mastermind, there are two players. One of which makes a hidden code while the other attempts to guess the code. In each attempt at guessing the hidden code, there will be hints given to help guide the guesser in how they guess. After a certain amount of rounds, either the guesser would have been victorious in finding the hidden code or not being able to correctly guess the code.    
Instead of having two players, with this project there is only one player that will constantly keep guessing the hidden code. The code is randomized so that there will be a new hidden code each round. For an indepth explanation of the device and how to operate it please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MPgmgXKV3s.

Note:   
In this repository there are the necessary header file and main-file code needed to replicate the device. Changes to the main-file code will be needed depending on how the hardware is configured.
